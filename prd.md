# Product Requirements Document: Restaurant Management Suite

## 1. Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive restaurant management system that streamlines operations through user authentication, menu management, staff scheduling, order processing, and analytics reporting. Delivery is sequenced to build core infrastructure first, then layer on business functionality with a focus on user experience and operational efficiency.

## 2. Objectives & Success Metrics

- Deliver a secure multi-role authentication system with Customer, Staff, Manager, and Admin access levels.
- Implement comprehensive menu management with CRUD operations, categorization, and inventory tracking.
- Provide intuitive staff scheduling with shift templates, coverage tracking, and conflict prevention.
- Build order processing system with real-time status tracking and payment integration.
- Create analytics dashboard with performance metrics, reporting capabilities, and data visualization.

Success metrics: All user roles can complete core workflows without errors, system supports concurrent users with <2s response time, and full test coverage passes.

## 3. Scope & Phasing

Work must ship in the following order, committing after each phase:

1. Core Infrastructure (Express.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, Authentication)
2. User Authentication & Authorization (Registration, Login, RBAC)
3. Menu Management System (CRUD, Categories, Inventory)
4. Staff Scheduling (Templates, Assignments, Calendar)
5. Order Management (Processing, Status, Payment)
6. Analytics & Reporting (Dashboard, Metrics, Export)
7. Testing & Documentation (Unit tests, API docs, User guides)
8. Performance Optimization (Caching, Monitoring, Polish)

Each phase closes with `git add .`, `git commit -m "<phase summary>"`, and updates to `progress.md`.

## 4. Personas & Use Cases

- **Customer**: Views menu, places orders, tracks order status.
- **Staff Member**: Manages assigned tasks, views schedules, processes orders.
- **Manager**: Oversees operations, manages staff schedules, reviews reports.
- **Admin**: System configuration, user management, full access control.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 User Authentication & Authorization

- Registration with email verification and secure password requirements.
- Login/logout with JWT token management and session security.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with four distinct permission levels.
- Password reset flow with email verification and security questions.
- Profile management allowing users to update personal information.
- Account lockout protection after failed login attempts.

### 5.2 Menu Management System

- Full CRUD operations for menu items with validation and error handling.
- Menu categorization system (appetizers, mains, desserts, beverages).
- Image upload functionality with file validation and optimization.
- Availability toggle for items (in-stock/out-of-stock management).
- Dynamic pricing system with promotional discounts and time-based offers.
- Search and filtering capabilities by category, price, availability.
- Inventory tracking with quantity on hand and reorder thresholds.

### 5.3 Staff Scheduling System

- Weekly schedule creation with shift template management.
- Staff assignment based on roles, availability, and requirements.
- Visual calendar interface with drag-and-drop functionality.
- Double-booking prevention with conflict detection algorithms.
- Shift coverage tracking and replacement request system.
- Time-off request management with approval workflow.
- Schedule change notifications via email/in-app alerts.

### 5.4 Order Management System

- Order creation with menu item selection and customization options.
- Real-time order status tracking (Draft, Confirmed, In Progress, Ready, Completed).
- Payment processing integration with multiple payment methods.
- Order history and receipt generation with PDF export.
- Kitchen display system for order preparation workflow.
- Customer notification system for order updates.
- Refund and cancellation handling with audit trails.

### 5.5 Analytics & Reporting Dashboard

- Popular menu items tracking with sales analytics.
- Staff utilization metrics and performance indicators.
- Revenue reporting with time-based filtering and comparisons.
- System usage statistics and user engagement metrics.
- Data visualization using charts and graphs (Chart.js integration).
- Export functionality for reports (CSV, PDF formats).
- Real-time dashboard with key performance indicators.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Technology Stack**: React.js frontend, Express.js with TypeScript backend, PostgreSQL database, Docker containerization.
- **Security**: JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, input validation, XSS prevention, CORS configuration, rate limiting.
- **Performance**: <2 second response time, concurrent user support, efficient database queries, caching implementation.
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture, horizontal scaling capability, database connection pooling, load balancing ready.
- **Testing**: Unit tests with Jest/Supertest, integration testing, >80% code coverage, CI/CD pipeline integration.

## 7. Dependencies & Risks

- Dependency on PostgreSQL database setup and Docker environment configuration.
- Risk of authentication security vulnerabilities; implement comprehensive security audit.
- Potential performance bottlenecks with concurrent users; require load testing validation.
- Image upload storage requirements; need cloud storage or local file system strategy.
- Payment integration complexity; may require third-party service integration research.

## 8. Open Questions

- Should the system support multi-location restaurant chains or single location only?
- What level of inventory automation is required (automatic reordering, supplier integration)?
- Should mobile app development be considered for future phases?
- What are the specific reporting requirements for tax and regulatory compliance?
