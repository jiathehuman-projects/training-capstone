- TypeORM with shared models - clean data layer
- HeroUI components - modern, accessible interface
- JWT authentication across microservices
- Playwright testing - caught real bugs

### **What I Learned:**
- Microservices debugging can be tricky (Customer API compilation issue taught me a lot)
- Integration testing is invaluable - found issues I'd never catch manually
- Proper git commit messages matter for project tracking
- Docker rebuilds solve more problems than you'd think 😅

## 🚨 **Challenges Overcome**

1. **Customer API Down** → Docker rebuild fixed TypeScript compilation
2. **Order Status Updates Failing** → Nginx proxy configuration resolved
3. **UI Layout Issues** → Responsive design improvements implemented
4. **Shift Application Conflicts** → Logic redesign to allow multiple daily applications
5. **Menu Price Display Bug** → Fixed field mapping in frontend

## 🔮 **Next Sprint Priorities**

1. **Performance optimization** - API response times and database queries
2. **Mobile responsive design** - Ensure great mobile experience
3. **Payment integration** - Add Stripe or similar for real payments
4. **Real-time notifications** - WebSocket integration for order updates
5. **Advanced analytics** - More detailed manager reporting

## 💭 **Personal Reflection**

This was an incredibly productive 4 days! Went from a basic app to a production-ready restaurant management system. The microservices architecture decision was the right call - it made debugging and scaling much easier.

The Playwright integration testing was a game-changer. Actually seeing the customer flow work end-to-end gave me so much confidence in the system.

Most satisfying moment: Watching a customer place an order, seeing it appear in the staff dashboard, and updating the order status - the whole workflow just *worked* 🚀

**Energy Level**: High! Ready for the next sprint 💪
